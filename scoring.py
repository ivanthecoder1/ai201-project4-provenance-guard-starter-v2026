"""
Turning two numbers into one, and one number into something a person can read.
← YOU BUILD THIS IN MILESTONES 4 AND 5

Two functions live here, and both are stubs.

`combine_signals` is where your false-positive decision from Milestone 1
actually gets made. Everything above it — the labels, the appeal path — is
downstream of a number this function produced.

`score_to_label` is where you stop writing for a machine and start writing for
a person. A score of 0.62 means nothing to a writer.

⚠️ Your README's **Signals and Scoring** section has to name the file and
function holding your combining rule. The grader checks your code against what
you claim, so that line should read `scoring.py::combine_signals`.

def combine_signals(model_score: float, style_score: float) -> float:
    """
    Combine two 0–1 signals into one 0–1 score. ← TODO (Milestone 4)

    Both inputs point the same way: higher means more likely AI. Your output
    should too.

    Args:
        model_score: from `detector.model_signal` — how predictable the text is.
        style_score: from `stylometry.style_signal` — the shape of the text.

    Returns:
        A float from 0.0 (confidently human) to 1.0 (confidently AI).

    ⚠️ **Write the rule down before you code it, and put the numbers in your
    README.** A weighted average is the obvious choice and it is not the only
    one. Things worth thinking about:

      - **What happens when they disagree?** One signal at 0.9 and the other at
        0.1 averages to 0.5 — "unsure". Is that what you want? It might be
        exactly right: two methods disagreeing IS uncertainty. Or you might
        decide one signal is more trustworthy when they split.

      - **Which way do you want to be wrong?** Weighting toward the signal that
        reads more human means fewer false accusations and more AI text
        getting through. There's no weighting that avoids the trade.

      - Milestone 4 asks you to find a case where your two signals split and
        write it down. That case is what this rule exists to handle.

    The weights in config.py are placeholders. Change them, or ignore them and
    write a different rule.

    Mine: average the two equally, then cap. If EITHER signal is below
    `config.DISAGREE_BELOW` (0.5 — that signal leans human), hold the result
    one step under `config.AI_THRESHOLD`, so a disagreement can land in
    "unsure" but can never produce an AI label.

    Equal weights because neither signal has earned more trust than the other.
    The cap is one-sided on purpose: a wrong human label costs nobody
    anything, a wrong AI label accuses a person. So only the AI side is held
    back, and the human side is left uncapped.

    What it costs: lightly-edited AI that trips one signal and not the other
    comes out "unsure" rather than "AI", and text that fools BOTH signals is
    labelled AI with nothing standing in the way.

def score_to_label(score: float) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Turn a score into a guess and the text a reader actually sees.
    ← TODO (Milestone 5)

    Returns:
        (guess, label_text) — where `guess` is a short machine-readable string
        like "ai" / "human" / "unsure", and `label_text` is the full sentence
        shown to a person.

    ⚠️ Write the label text for someone who has never heard the word
    "threshold".

        ✗ "human, 0.81 confidence"
        ✓ "We think this was probably written by a person."

    All three labels have to be **reachable**. If no score can produce one of
    them, your ranges have a gap — and Milestone 5 asks you to submit text that
    produces each one, which is how you'd find out.

    The hardest one to write is "unsure". It has to admit uncertainty without
    sounding like an accusation, because the person reading it may well have
    written every word themselves. Your breakout asks your group what they'd
    think if they got it on their own work. That question is the whole
    milestone.

    Mine: three sentences, no numbers in any of them. The reader gets a plain
    statement of what we think and nothing that looks like a verdict.

    The "unsure" one says "we could not tell" rather than anything about the
    writing itself, because the person reading it may well have written every
    word. Saying the text "has some AI-like qualities" sounds like a soft
    accusation; saying we could not tell puts the failure on us, which is
    where it belongs.
